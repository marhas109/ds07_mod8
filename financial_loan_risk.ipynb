        "##### Current State #####\n",
        "\n",
        "FinTech Innovation currently has a manual approval process for new loans. This a common practice in the financial services industry, particularly for new or fast-growing companies that have have not yet built automated loan processing infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the current process, individual loan officers review each loan application, making a go/no go decision based on company guidelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "The current state has the following challenges and risks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Manual review is time-consuming and inefficient. Each application requires 5-10 minutes of loan officer time, which in turn is unavailable for business development and customer service.\n",
        "- Manual review is also inconsistent. Individual loan officers interpret lending guidelines differently and the manual process is also prone to simple human error.\n",
        "- Loan processing takes days or sometimes weeks. \n",
        "    - This creates an opportunity cost for FinTech since delaying loan approval costs the company revenue.\n",
        "    - This is also a suboptimal experience for FinTech's customers.\n",
        "- Loan decisions are high-stakes events: each bad loan that is approved costs the company an average of $50,000, and each good loan that is not approved has an opportunity cost of $8,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "We believe that reimaging the loan approval process and moving to a data-led approach will produce significant benefits to the company, our loan officers, and our customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Project Stakeholders #####\n",
        "\n",
        "This work will impact a large number of people in and around FinTech Innovations, but there are 3 groups whose stake in this work is most significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. FinTech Innovations senior leadership team. Rebuilding the loan approval process will require a large investment of time from a wide range of employees, and the senior leadership team will need:\n",
        "    - Clearly articulated, measurable benefits to justify this change\n",
        "    - A simple way to understand how the new data tools work, and how they are used\n",
        "2. FinTech Innovations loan officers. These employees will be directly impacted by any changes we make, and are the company's link to our customers. They will need:\n",
        "    - An understanding of how their work will change and why\n",
        "    - Data tools that are easy for them to learn and use\n",
        "    - Talking points and explanations on how the new loan approval process works for customers\n",
        "3. FinTech Innovations customers (current and future). This group will be directly impacted by these changes; while they will not have input into our business operations, they will need:\n",
        "    - A high-level understanding of the loan process and confidence in its reliability and fairness\n",
        "    - A understanding of the benefits of this change, and what they can expect when they apply for loans.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Model Outcome Considerations #####\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this work will be a model that performs well across as many factors as possible, but I will give the most consideration to avoiding incorrectly classifying high-risk applications as low-risk. This error is the most costly to the business--as previously mentioned, the average cost of a defaulted loan is $50,000 while the average revenues from a good loan are $8,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### My Approach #####\n",
        "\n",
        "I will seek to build a model that calculates applicants' risk of default. I think this is the right approach because it will give FinTech Innovations the best information on how to predict which loans will be successful. This will be a regression exercise to sort applicants into high and low risk of default.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although there is meaningful value in trying to predict loan approval decisions, I worry that this model will codify biases and unfair practices hidden in the current state."
